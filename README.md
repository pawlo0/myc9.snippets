# myc9.snippets

Code completion snippets for Cloud9

You shouldn't relly in this code as I'm experimenting building my first snippets for Cloud9

Try someone else's, like (https://github.com/kristiehowboutdat/c9.snippets)

## To make changes
- Edit the `.snippets` file(s) and save
- To publish changes, run `c9 build` in the root directory (where the `package.json` is). This will create or update the `c9build` directory.
- To include your plugin/snippet, commit and push the git repo, and then include the path to your `.js` file (ex. `https://path.to.your.repo.com/c9build/package.YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME.js`) inside the `c9build` directory in your `init.js` script
- Make sure to refresh your AWS Cloud9 window after you make changes to your hosted snippets
